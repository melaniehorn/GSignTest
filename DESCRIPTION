Description: The sign depth and sign depth test can be used for testing robustly
    on parameter vectors of regression models. For this, the sign depth test
    needs an order of the residuals. While there is an inherent order in the
    case of simple regression or, for example, time-series, there is no inherent
    order in the case of multiple regression. For this, the design vectors of
    a data set have to be ordered. This package provides 13 different ordering
    strategies as well as functions for calculating the sign depth, the sign
    depth test, the simplified sign depth and two classical tests for regression
    models, namely the sign test and the F-test.
